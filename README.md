ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aditya

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m pursuing a journey as an Android Developer with a pinch of generalist seasoning.

ğŸŒ± Currently brewing skills in Kotlin, Java, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

âš¡ Fun fact: Laziness is my default mode, but when Iâ€™m hyped, I go all-inâ€”regardless of skill level!
